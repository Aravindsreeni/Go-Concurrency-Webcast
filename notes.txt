Go
    another PL
    * Built for concurrency

    simplifying the language features
        25 keywords

        No implicit conversions
        No classes (only structs & functions)
        No inheritance (only composition)
        No generics
        No immutable

        Support for pointers


Multi Threading
    Race conditions & dead locks

Single Threading (Event Loop) (ex Node.js)
    Suited for IO
    Extremely complicated to solve CPU intensive operations


Threading is a solution offered through APIs
    
    var x = 100;

    var fn = () => {
        lock();
        x + 10;
        unlock()
    }
    var t1 = new Thread(fn)
    var t2 = new Thread(fn)

goroutine

    go fn()
    channels
    select & range

    sync package
        No shared state


Threads are costly

ch chan

f1(){
    ch <- x
}

f2(){
    y := <- ch
    //some code
}

f2()
f1()

Higher Order Functions
    Functions as first class objects
